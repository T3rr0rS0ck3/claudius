# Claudius - KI Usage Pet

**A tiny pixel-art desktop pet for Windows that keeps an eye on the usage limits of your AI coding assistant — and gets visibly nervous when you're about to run out.**

![The pet in different moods: happy after a reset, thinking, panicking, sleeping](docs/moods.png)

Many AI coding subscriptions come with a rolling **5-hour session limit** and a **weekly limit**.
**Claudius - KI Usage Pet** sits on your desktop and shows how much of both you've used — at a glance, without
opening anything. The more you use, the more its mood changes: relaxed → thoughtful → nervous → panicking → asleep
until the limit resets.

> The interface is available in English and German (settings → *Language*). Bubble texts can be changed to any
> language (see [Configuration](#configuration)).

## Features

- 🟠 **Desktop pet** — transparent, borderless, draggable, optionally always on top
- 🚶 **Walks around** — strolls along the taskbar and the tops of open windows, jumps up onto windows,
  climbs the screen edges, swings along the top of the screen until it drops, and falls off when a window
  moves away; after a long fall it splats into a puddle, drops flying off, and pulls itself back together. Its mood sets the pace
  (can be turned off). Optionally it also walks or hops over to the neighbouring monitor, following how your
  monitors are arranged in Windows
- 🐭 **Chases the pointer** — now and then, when calm, it eyes the mouse pointer nearby and runs after it; hold the pointer
  above it and it hops up to grab it three times, then bursts into tears (can be turned off)
- 🎨 **Your color** — pick any color for the pet in the inventory; the usage overlay, menus and speech bubbles use it as accent color
- 👑 **A wardrobe per model** — out of the box a crown for Opus, sunglasses for Sonnet, a little flower for Haiku and a wizard's hat for Fable; in the inventory (right-click → **Inventory…**) you dress each model yourself from hats, glasses, a moustache, a bow tie, a scarf and more (can be turned off)
- 🏆 **Achievements** — 15 things to do together, from the first session to 25 cookies or a night in bed; each one unlocks a costume for the wardrobe, and the pet cheers when it happens. Tracked only on your computer
- 🎃 **Seasonal headwear** — a witch's hat and a broom in October, a Santa hat until Christmas, bunny ears at Easter and a party hat
  on New Year's Eve and your birthday; they take the place of the model's headwear (can be turned off)
- 🌙 **Night mode** — between 23:00 and 06:00 (adjustable) the pet wears a nightcap and says good night; a bed turns up on the
  taskbar and it walks over and goes to sleep in it. A click wakes it for a moment; grab it by the head to take it out (it walks
  back) or by the blanket to move it with its bed. In the morning it stretches, says good morning and the bed goes
- 📊 **Usage overlay** — click the pet to see session and weekly usage, reset times and a forecast, each with a chart of the current window (the forecast dashed up to the limit; hover it for time and value)
- 🎭 **7 moods** with their own animations, based on the higher of the two usage values
- 💬 **Speech bubbles** when thresholds are crossed, e.g. *"90 %! 😰"* — not constantly chattering
- 🔔 **Windows notifications** at configurable session and weekly warning thresholds
- 📈 **Forecast** — "at the current pace you'll hit the limit in 1h 42m"
- 🗓️ **Weekly review** — after the weekly reset the pet sums up the past week ("Last week: 87%, busiest day: Tuesday"), also shown in the usage overlay
- ☕ **Break reminder** — after 2 hours (adjustable in minutes) of work by the AI assistant without a break, and when a limit is reached, the pet stretches and suggests a break; 10 minutes without activity count as a break
- 🧺 **Tray icon** that reflects the current mood, plus autostart with Windows
- 👻 **Ghost drag** — drag a ghost of the pet (left mouse button) onto an Explorer window to open the assistant in that folder
- 📄 **File drop** — drag a file from Explorer onto the pet to open the assistant in its folder with the file as `@file`
- 📂 **Project launcher** — double-click the pet to pick a project from your repo folder and open the assistant there
- 🎤 **Voice chat** (optional) — opens the assistant with its voice dictation switched on; the pet listens while you talk
- ❓ **Session status** — a yellow "?" when a session asks something, a bubble when it is done;
  click the "?" to jump to that session's window
- 🤒 **Feeling sick** — as a session's context window fills up (60 / 75 / 90 %, adjustable) the pet turns greener and more
  tired, turns down cookies and suggests `/compact`; at the top level a grim reaper floats along behind it. After `/compact`
  or `/clear` it recovers and the reaper fades away
- ⚙️ **Configurable** thresholds, texts, size, update interval, console and more
- 🔒 **Local only** — the pet itself makes no network requests, needs no login and reads no tokens; it only reads what the assistant already hands to its status line

## Requirements

- Windows 10 or 11 (x64)
- An AI coding assistant CLI that hands rate-limit data to a status line command, signed in with a subscription
  that has session and weekly limits (only those plans report rate-limit data)

No .NET installation needed — the installer is self-contained.

## Installation

1. Download **`Claudius-Setup-x.y.z.exe`** from the [latest release](https://github.com/T3rr0rS0ck3/claudius/releases/latest).
2. Run it. No admin rights required (installs to `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\Claudius`).
3. Keep **"Connect to the AI assistant"** checked. This adds the pet as the assistant's `statusLine` (only if you don't have one yet).
4. Send any message in the assistant — after the first response the pet knows your usage.

Prefer no installer? Grab the `portable.zip` from the release, extract it anywhere and start `Claudius.exe`.
Then right-click the pet → *Connect AI assistant…*.

> **Windows SmartScreen** may warn about an unknown publisher because the installer isn't code-signed.
> Click *More info → Run anyway*.

### Updates

The pet looks for a new release on start and once a day. When there is one, it tells you and the right-click
menu shows **Install update to x.y.z…**: one click downloads the setup, checks it against
the release's `SHA256SUMS.txt`, installs it silently and restarts the pet. Portable copies only get a link to the
release page. You can switch the check off or run it by hand in the settings (*Updates*).

Versions from before the rename to Claudius update the same way: the new version moves their settings over, points the
status line at the new bridge and removes the old program folder.

## Using the pet

| Action | Result |
|---|---|
| Left-click the pet | Open / close the usage overlay |
| Double-click the pet | Project list: open the assistant in one of your projects |
| Right-drag the pet | Move it (position is remembered); it kicks its legs while carried and, when walking around, drops down from there |
| Drag the pet onto an Explorer window | Open the assistant in that folder (see [Opening the assistant](#opening-the-assistant)) |
| Drag files from Explorer onto the pet | Open the assistant in their folder and hand it the files (see [Opening the assistant](#opening-the-assistant)) |
| Hover the pet | Emote buttons: feed 🍪, pat ❤, play ⚽ and tickle 🪶 it, each with its own reaction (can be turned off) |
| Right-click the pet | Menu: usage, open assistant, voice chat, say hello, always on top, walk around, minimize to tray, connect AI assistant, settings, quit |
| Left-click the tray icon | Open the usage overlay |
| Start `Claudius.exe` again | Brings the running pet back and opens the overlay |

## Opening the assistant

The pet can open the assistant's CLI in a folder of your choice. Where it opens is set in the settings
(*Open assistant in*): *Automatic* (Windows Terminal if installed, otherwise Command Prompt), Windows Terminal,
Command Prompt, PowerShell or *Desktop app (Code tab)*. The desktop option starts the CLI with `--desktop` in the
folder, which needs the assistant's desktop app and an up-to-date CLI.

**Ghost drag.** Hold the **left** mouse button on the pet and drag. A translucent ghost of the pet follows the cursor
while the pet itself stays where it is. Over an Explorer window or the desktop the ghost lights up and waves. Release
it there and the assistant opens in that folder (with Windows 11 tabs: the active tab); the ghost floats away.
Releasing anywhere else, or pressing `Esc`, cancels. Folders without a file system path (e.g. *This PC*) get a short
"no folder here" bubble. Can be switched off in the settings.

**File drop.** Drag one or more files from Explorer onto the pet: it opens its mouth and reaches for them. Let go and
the assistant opens in the files' folder with `@"file"` as its first message, so it reads them right away. A folder
dropped on its own opens like the ghost drag. The desktop app does not take a first message; there only the folder opens.

**Project list.** Double-click the pet (or right-click → *Open assistant…*, also in the tray menu). The list shows your
recently opened projects first, then all subfolders of your **repo folder** (hidden folders and folders starting with
`.` are skipped). *Choose another folder…* opens any folder, *Set repo folder…* changes the repo folder. On first
use the pet asks for the repo folder right away. A single click now waits for the double-click time before opening
the usage overlay.

**Voice chat.** Off by default; switch on *Offer voice chat* in the settings to get the menu entry
*Start voice chat…*. It uses the assistant's voice dictation: on first use the pet asks to set `voice.enabled` in
the assistant's `settings.json` (a backup is saved), then shows the project list. In the console, **hold Space** and
speak. Requirements: the assistant signed in with an account (not an API key) and microphone access for the console
(Windows Settings → Privacy & security → Microphone). The CLI has no command-line flag for voice mode, so dictation is
enabled for all of its sessions while the option is on. Switching *Offer voice chat* off again hides the menu entry and
sets `voice.enabled` back to `false`.
While you hold Space in a focused terminal running the assistant (with dictation on), the pet stops and talks into a
microphone, with sound waves rising above it. The assistant does not report dictation itself, so the pet goes by the held Space key.

### Moods

The mood follows the **higher** of session and weekly usage. All thresholds are configurable.

| Usage | Mood | What the pet does |
|---:|---|---|
| 0–49 % | 🟢 relaxed | breathes, blinks, waves now and then |
| 50–69 % | 🟢 normal | looks around |
| 70–84 % | 🟡 attentive | thinks hard (thought dots) |
| 85–89 % | 🟠 nervous | sweats, fidgets |
| 90–94 % | 🔴 worried | big eyes, trembling |
| 95–99 % | 🔴 panic | turns red, arms up, flashing "!" |
| 100 % | 😴 limit reached | sleeps until the reset |

While the assistant is actively sending data, a calm pet "types" along. After a reset it cheers.

## How it works

```text
AI assistant ── status line JSON (stdin) ──▶ ClaudiusBridge.exe ──▶ %LOCALAPPDATA%\Claudius\usage.json
                                                    │                                  ▲
                                                    │                                  │ polls
                                                    └── prints the status line   Claudius.exe (the pet)
```

The assistant runs its configured status line command after each response and passes session data — including
`rate_limits.five_hour` and `rate_limits.seven_day` — as JSON on stdin. `ClaudiusBridge.exe` is that command: it
stores the values locally and prints a compact status line back into the assistant:

```text
[Opus] Session 73% (↻ 2h 14m) · Week 61%
```

The pet app runs independently and keeps working when no assistant terminal is open; values whose reset time
has passed are treated as 0 %. Nothing is scraped from any website and no credentials are read.

## Questions and finished work

Once the assistant is connected, the pet also registers a few hooks in the assistant's `settings.json` (a backup is
saved; your own hooks are kept). Then:

- **"?"** (yellow) appears when a session asks for a permission, uses *AskUserQuestion* or needs input, with a bubble
  like *"my-project: The assistant has a question."*
- When a session finished its turn, a bubble like *"my-project: The assistant is done!"* pops up; no mark stays on the pet.
- With several sessions the "?" stays as long as any of them waits for an answer.
- **Feeling sick**: the status line also reports how full each session's context window is. With several sessions the
  fullest one counts: from 60 % the pet looks unwell, from 75 % a bubble suggests `/compact`, from 90 % it shivers, is
  too weak to climb, jump or chase the pointer, and a grim reaper turns up behind it. `/compact` or `/clear` makes it well again.
- **Jump to a session**: clicking the "?" brings the window of the session that asked to the front:
  the console window, the Windows Terminal window with the right tab selected, or the desktop app.
  The hook notes the window when the session starts and asks; sessions from before that are looked for by folder name.

Only rare events are hooked (prompt sent, turn finished, permission/question, session start/end), so the assistant is
not slowed down. No hook reports an answered permission prompt; the "?" goes away once the session's conversation log
grows again. Switching *“?” on questions …* off in the settings removes the hooks again. Bubble texts: `Question`,
`Done`, `NoWindow` (with `{folder}`).

### Desktop app

The Code tab of the assistant's desktop app reads the same `settings.json` and runs the same hooks, so its
sessions get "?" and bubbles too, side by side with terminal sessions; bubbles mark them with *(Desktop)*.
While any session works the pet types, even if no status line data arrives. Mood and limits still come from the status
line, which the desktop app may not run; then they only update from terminal sessions. Dictation is noticed in the
desktop app as well. The normal desktop chat offers no hooks and is not supported.

## Configuration

Most options are available via right-click → **Settings…**: language, repo folder, console, ghost drag,
voice chat, size, always on top, animations, walking around, crossing monitors, chasing the pointer, emotes, night mode and night hours, break reminder, autostart, update checks, update interval, warning thresholds, mood thresholds,
speech bubbles, notifications and your name. Color, costumes (including seasonal headwear and the birthday), and the model and effort for new sessions are in right-click → **Inventory…**.

Everything lives in `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Claudius\settings.json`, and manual edits are picked up live.
`Language` is `en` or `de`. Speech bubble texts are under `Texts`; switching the language in the settings resets them
to that language's defaults. Each event can have several variants; one is picked at random:

```json
"Texts": {
  "Worried":   ["{percent}%! 😰"],
  "Panic":     ["{NAME}. ALMOST EMPTY."],
  "Exhausted": ["Okay... sleeping until the reset."],
  "Reset":     ["Fresh quota! Let's go!"]
}
```

Events: `Greeting`, `NoData`, `Normal`, `Attentive`, `Nervous`, `Worried`, `Panic`, `Exhausted`, `Reset`, `Poke`,
`Launch` (assistant opened), `NoFolder` (ghost dropped where there is no folder), `Voice` (voice chat started),
`GoodNight` (the night starts), `GoodMorning` (the night ends).
Placeholders: `{name}`, `{NAME}` (upper case), `{percent}` (the higher value), `{session}`, `{week}`,
`{folder}` (name of the opened folder, for `Launch` and `Voice`).

Other keys for opening the assistant: `ReposPath`, `Terminal` (`Auto`, `WindowsTerminal`, `Cmd`, `PowerShell`, `Desktop`),
`GhostDrag`, `VoiceChat` and `RecentProjects` (the last 10 opened folders).

Seasonal headwear and night: `SeasonalAccessories`, `Birthday` (`"MM-dd"`, e.g. `"03-14"`), `NightMode`, `NightStart` and
`NightEnd` (`"HH:mm"`, a night may span midnight). Set `CLAUDIUS_FAKE_NOW` (e.g. `2026-12-24T22:59`) to try them at another date and time.

## Troubleshooting

**The pet says it's waiting for data.**
Check that the pet is connected (right-click → settings shows the status), then send a message in the assistant.
Rate-limit data only arrives after the first response of a session and only for subscription plans with limits.

**I already had a custom status line.**
The installer never overwrites it. Connecting from the app asks first and saves a backup next to the assistant's
`settings.json` (`settings.json.claudius-backup`). Only one status line command can be active.

**Opening the assistant fails with "The AI assistant was not found".**
The pet looks for the CLI on the `PATH` and in `%USERPROFILE%\.local\bin`. The settings window shows which one was
found. Install the CLI or add it to the `PATH`, then restart the pet.

**The ghost doesn't light up over an Explorer window.**
Only Explorer windows and the desktop are targets; other apps (e.g. file dialogs or IDEs) and the pet itself are ignored.

**Voice dictation doesn't react.**
Check the microphone permission for your console and that the assistant is signed in with an account.
The assistant's voice command shows its status.

**Something seems off.**
Look at `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Claudius\log.txt`. `usage.json` there shows the last values received from the assistant.

## Uninstall

Uninstall *Claudius - KI Usage Pet* via Windows Settings → Apps. This also removes the status line entry from the
assistant and the autostart entry. Your settings stay in `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Claudius` — delete that folder for a clean slate.

## Building from source

Requires the .NET 10 SDK (or newer).

```powershell
git clone https://github.com/T3rr0rS0ck3/claudius.git
cd claudius
.\build.ps1                        # framework-dependent build → dist\Claudius
.\build.ps1 -SelfContained -Version 1.2.3
.\dist\Claudius\Claudius.exe
```

Set `CLAUDIUS_DATA_DIR` to point the app and bridge at a different data folder, e.g. for testing with fake `usage.json` files.

### Releases

Pushing a tag like `v1.2.3` runs the [release workflow](.github/workflows/release.yml). It builds a self-contained
version, packs the Inno Setup installer and a portable zip, and publishes a GitHub release. Tags with a suffix
(`v1.2.3-beta`) become pre-releases. Existing tags can be rebuilt via *Actions → Release → Run workflow*.

### Project structure

## Roadmap

- Per-model limits (e.g. Opus / Sonnet) once the data is reliably available
- Usage history and statistics
- More characters, skins and sound effects

## Disclaimer

This is an independent project. The pixel character is an original drawing.

## Privacy

The app sends no data to the developer or third parties. Its only network access is the optional update check
against GitHub, see the [privacy policy](PRIVACY.md).
